## Features

### Notes:

- Input words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user. e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.


- Commands in square brackets are optional. e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.


- Commands separated by `|` within `()` suggest that only one of the commands must be present to be valid.


- Items with `â€¦` after them can be used multiple times, including zero. e.g., [t/TAG] â€¦â€‹ can be used
  (i.e. 0 or more times), t/friend t/family etc.


- Parameters can be in any order. e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.


- Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored. e.g., if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** All commands from this point onwards are to be
executed in lower case. E.g., `find` is valid, but `FIND` or `FinD` is considered as invalid. Keywords following commands do
not need to be in lower case.
