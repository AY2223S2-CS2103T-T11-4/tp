## Features

####Notes:
- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.
e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

- Items in square brackets are optional.
e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

- Items with `…` after them can be used multiple times including zero times.
e.g. [t/TAG]…​ can be used as   (i.e. 0 times), t/friend, t/friend t/family etc.
- Parameters can be in any order.
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
- Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
